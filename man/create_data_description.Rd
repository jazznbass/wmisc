\title{Create a description of a dataset}
\usage{
create_data_description(dat, readme = FALSE, tab = "   ", max_char = 60)
}
\arguments{
\item{dat}{A data.frame or a character string pointing to an \code{.rds} file to load.
If a character string is provided and ends with \code{.rds}, the file will be loaded using \code{readRDS()}.}

\item{readme}{Logical. If \code{TRUE}, the output is appended to a file named \code{"README.md"}. Default is \code{FALSE}.}

\item{max_char}{Integer. Maximum number of characters to show per variable summary.
Longer content will be truncated. Default is \code{60}.}

\item{tabs}{Integer. Number of tab characters (\verb{\\\\t}) to use for formatting. Default is \code{1}.}
}
\value{
Invisibly returns a character vector with one entry per column describing its contents.
Side effect: prints the description to the console, and optionally to a README file.
}
\description{
Generates a concise textual description of a dataset, summarizing each column's type,
number of missing values, and a short overview of its content (e.g., range or levels).
Optionally, this description can be written to a \code{README.md} file.

}
\details{
For each column in the dataset, the function provides:
\itemize{
\item The column name
\item The type (\code{typeof})
\item The number of missing values
\item A brief summary:
\itemize{
\item For factors: list of levels (possibly truncated)
\item For numeric variables: value range
\item For character variables: coerced to factor and listed as above
}
}
}
\examples{
df <- data.frame(
  id = 1:10,
  group = factor(c("A", "B")),
  score = c(NA, 2:10)
)
create_data_description(df)
