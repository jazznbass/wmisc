\title{Compute Confidence Intervals for Test Scores Adjusted for Reliability}
\usage{
ci_score(x, rtt, m, s, ci)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{Numeric value representing the observed test score.}

\item{rtt}{Numeric value between 0 and 1 indicating the reliability coefficient of the test (e.g., test-retest reliability).}

\item{m}{Numeric value representing the mean of the test scores in the population.}

\item{s}{Numeric value representing the standard deviation of the test scores in the population.}

\item{ci}{Numeric value between 0 and 1 indicating the desired confidence level (e.g., 0.95 for a 95\% confidence interval).}
}
\value{
A list containing the following components:
\describe{
\item{\code{scale}}{
A named numeric vector with the confidence interval in raw score units:
\itemize{
\item \code{lower}: Lower bound of the confidence interval.
\item \code{x}: The observed test score.
\item \code{upper}: Upper bound of the confidence interval.
\item \code{range}: Width of the confidence interval.
}
}
\item{\code{z}}{
A named numeric vector with the confidence interval in z-score units:
\itemize{
\item \code{lower}: Lower bound in z-scores.
\item \code{x}: Observed score in z-scores.
\item \code{upper}: Upper bound in z-scores.
\item \code{range}: Width of the confidence interval in z-scores.
}
}
\item{\code{percentile}}{
A named numeric vector with the confidence interval in percentiles:
\itemize{
\item \code{lower}: Lower percentile.
\item \code{x}: Percentile rank of the observed score.
\item \code{upper}: Upper percentile.
\item \code{range}: Width of the confidence interval in percentiles.
}
}
\item{\code{parameters}}{
A named numeric vector with additional parameters:
\itemize{
\item \code{se}: Standard error of measurement adjusted for reliability.
\item \code{ci}: Confidence level used.
\item \code{ci_factor}: Z-score multiplier corresponding to the confidence level.
}
}
}
}
\description{
Calculates the confidence interval around an observed test score, adjusting for test reliability.
Returns the confidence interval in raw score units, z-scores, and percentiles.
}
\details{
The standard error (\code{se}) is calculated using the formula:
\deqn{se = s \times \sqrt{1 - rtt}}
where \code{s} is the standard deviation and \code{rtt} is the reliability coefficient.

The confidence interval is computed using the normal distribution quantile corresponding to the specified confidence level.

# Calculate a 95\% confidence interval for an observed score of 100
ci_score(x = 100, rtt = 0.9, m = 100, s = 15, ci = 0.95)
